## What we are building

- shows one player name randomly, and the user must pick their country
- 5 rounds, keep track of score
- grabs top 100 tennis players with country

## Future improvements

- have users login with supabase
- store highscores in supabase
- choose difficulty (would change the rank of players selected)
- challenge other users
